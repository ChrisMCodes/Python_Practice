This is a very simple function to sing the song 99 bottles of beer on the wall in Python. It is extraordinarily simple and will hopefully be the beginning of a lot of commits to this site. My thanks go to Linus Torvalds for this site, to years of car trips for the song, and to the project list at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit for the idea.
